* FPS convertion counter table per each GPU processes out of the 3 active ones, showing speed in real time
* Show which GPU "core" is used for each processed video
* Add a STOP button, very important, halt every related process to avoid some unusual behavior
* For common settings, like quality, add a slider. Access these settings by clicking some enable advanced settings button and it'd show in the main window
* Another column of converted in X seconds for processed videos
* Add ticks or box checks to enable different kinds of columns
* Take all metadata from previous file and include it in the converted file, especially the creation date, not the date modified, but specifically to have the original creation date and time in the metadata of the new file
* Custom FFmpeg instructions
* Separate logic from GUI
* Include REGEX
* Use a smart filename converter, including REGEX, to efficiently batch rename files based on patterns
